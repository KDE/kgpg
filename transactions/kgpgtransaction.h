 * @brief Process one GnuPG operation

 * This class encapsulates one GnuPG operation. It will care for all
 * interaction with the gpg process. Everything you have to care about
 * is to set up the object properly, call start() and catch the done signal.
 *
 * This is an abstract base class for specific operations that implements
 * the basic I/O loop, the process setup and interaction and some convenience
 * members to set extra arguments for the process.
 *
 * If you want to add a new operation create a child class that implements
 * nextLine(). Ususally you also need a constructor that takes some information
 * like the id of the key to modify.
