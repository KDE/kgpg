/**
 * \brief A interface to GnuPG handling UTF8 recoding correctly
 *
 * This class handles the GnuPG formatted UTF8 output correctly.
 * GnuPG recodes some characters as \\xnn where nn is the hex representation
 * of the character. This can't be fixed up simply when using QString as
 * QString already did it's own UTF8 conversion. Therefore we replace this
 * sequences by their corresponding character so QString will work just fine.
 *
 * As we know that GnuPG limits it's columns by ':' we skip \\x3a. Since this
 * is an ascii character (single byte) the replacement can be done later without
 * problems after the line has been split into pieces.
